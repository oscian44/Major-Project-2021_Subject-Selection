- Binary Search function for subjects by name
- Binary sorting routine by subject unit worth
- Subject selections are stored within an array
- Scripted buttons to add subjects to your selection
    - React if subject is selected or not
- Validation to assure a minimum of 12 units is selected and a maximum of 14 units
- System to hide alternate levels of subjects once one has been selected
